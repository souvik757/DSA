````
 Heap is CBT , that comes with a heap priority order
 - > In MaxHeap  , root.val >= child.val  
 - > In MinHeap  , root.val <= child.val
 üí° Heap is what PriorityQueue is and how it is implemented in the backend ?

## Built in Heap in java
```
In java collection interface 
, by default PriorityQueue provides features of a minheap . 
- Queue<T> minheap = new PriorityQueue<>() ; 
To use maxheap as a PriorityQueue 
- Queue<T> maxheap = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.reverseOrder()) ; 
```
